 * Date: September 15, 2012
 * 
 * 
 * Problem Statement: Write a program that will read in a line of tesxt as input
 * and then output the line with the first word moved to the end of the line.
 * Assume that there is no space before the first word and that the end of the 
 * first word is indicated by a blank.
 *
 * Overall plan:
 * 1.) ask user to input a line of text
 * 2.) take the first word of text and put it on to the end of the sentence
 * 3.) drop off the first letterÂ so i can capitolize it
 * 4.) put the letter back onto the sentence and add a question mark to the end
 * 5.) print out the rephrased sentence along with a message
